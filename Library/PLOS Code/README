--> 'TCGA Raw Data' contains the original data extracted from GDC without preprocessing.

--> In 'DEG R', R scripts for DEG are saved. Datasets for DEG and differentially expressed genes are saved here.

--> In 'Clean Data' the final database is saved.

--> 'PLOS Results' contains the main outputs of paper code.


# EXECUTION PROCESS #

----> 'preprocessing_1.py' runs the first part of the preprocessing process and creates 'data_deg_bbdd.csv' in 'DEG R' folder.

----> 'edgeR_DEG_bbdd.R' scripts executes the DEG of the specific 'data_deg_bbdd.csv' database. 'master.R' executes DEG for all databases. Generates the list of DEG genes for each database in 'deg_genes_bbdd.csv' file in 'DEG R' folder.

----> 'preprocessing_2.py' runs the second part of the preprocessing process using the DEG genes. Generates the final database and saves it in 'Clean Data' folder.

----> 'plos_code.py' executes the script for building networks and extract metrics using miRNetClassifier. Outputs are saved in 'PLOS Results'.
